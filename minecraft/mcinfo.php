            <h1>You can connect to our Minecraft server using the ip: mc.ForeverAFK.net</h1>

            <h1>Minecraft Server</h1>
            <h2>Server Information</h2>
            The ForeverAFK Minecraft server is a multiworld SMP server with available plot protection. There are two main worlds: Khutu and Sigby. Khutu is the world you will first spawn in. The largest majority of this world is free for everyone to build in. This leaves players builds vulnerable to thieves and griefers. Once a player has been on the server for 2 hours they gain access to Sigby. Unlike Khutu, players will not be able to build anywhere in Sigby unless they own a specific plot of land that is protected from other players.
            </br><img src="\resource\WorldDiagram.png"></br>
            The diagram above shows the basic architecture of the server. New players will be constrained to Khutu until they are promoted. At this point they will gain access to a build plot in Crafterville, and access the protected member world, Sigby. Meilin is an old free-for-all world that is being phased out by Khutu. Don't leave anything in Meilin as it will be deleted.
            </br>
            <h2>Server Rules</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Asking for Mod will get you kicked. Asking again will get you banned. Being a Mod is a responsibility, not an honor. It will also tell me that you haven't even bothered to read the rules.</li>
                <li>Client mods are allowed only if they do not alter gameplay and are in good spirit with the game. For example, maps and graphical mods are allowed, but flying and hack clients are not. When in doubt ask a Mod.</li>
                <li>Any attempt to cheat/hack will be swiftly rewarded with a permaban. This includes exploiting bugs on the server that obviously shouldn't be there. Please report these issues to a Mod immediately.</li>
                <li>There is absolutely NO GRIEFING in Sigby.</li>
                <li>Khutu is unprotected and free-for-all. Protect yourself and your things at all times.</li>
                <li>Use common sense and be respectful. We are all here to have fun, and the Mods are here to help make the server a good place for everyone.</li>
            </ol>
            </br>
            <h2>Server Policy</h2>
            <h3>Ranks and Promotion</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>[Peasant] - This is the default rank. Players may only access Khutu.</li>
                <li>[Gendry] - After two hours playtime a Peasant is promoted to Gendry. They can now access Crafterville and claim plots there with protection, and build in Sigby if a Lord grants them permission on their property.</li>
                <li>[Lord] - Lords are players who have purchased large plots in game with Loyalty Points. Lords may rent parts of their land to Gendry's for whatever price they see fit(with in-game items like diamonds, iron, gold, etc.). Lords are the keepers of the protected areas and handle disputes within their plots.</li>
                <li>(Various titles) - VIP - This is our VIP rank. We honor our best friends and special guests with this rank.</li>
                <li>Mod - Moderator - Mods have taken on the responsibility of helping other players with any problems. They are giving up their game-time to help others, so please treat them respectfully.</li>
                <li>YouTubers & Streamers - If you make Minecraft videos or stream online while on our server we would love to give you special recognition! Please send us a link to your pages either in game or email to ash@foreverafk.net and we can work out special ranks.</li>
            </ol>
            </br>
            <h3>Multiworld Architecture</h3>
            The server is running two overworlds: A protected world, Sigby, and a free-for-all world, Khutu. Khutu includes access to a Nether world, as well as an End world. Portals in Sigby have been disabled, and lead nowhere. </br>
            From time to time the server will be migrating into a new Khutu world. During this time there will be 3 active overworlds. It is strongly suggested that you move all of your valuables into the new Khutu (or better yet to Sigby) so that you aren't missing anything when the migration is completed. This includes anything in the Nether and End worlds as well. As of March 2015 the newest active world is Khutu, and Meilin is the world being phased out.
            <h3>Plot Ownership</h3>
            Lords own all of land in Sigby. At their discretion they may sublet portions to Gendrys. Any person who has been inactive in their region is subject to eviction, with a warning period of no less than 2 weeks.</br>
            Crafterville is a plotgrid world that is a great place to prove your building skills to landlords. Lords will look here to find builders worthy of building on plots in Sigby, so use them not only to store your items but to show off your building prowess! You are allowed two separate plots so use your space wisely.
            </br>
            <h1>Mumble VOIP</h1>
            We also host a Mumble chat server if you want to talk voice-to-voice. You can usually find Erk and Ash in there when they are on. If we do happen to be streaming we ask that you configure push-to-talk or have a decent noise gate, otherwise we will mute you.
