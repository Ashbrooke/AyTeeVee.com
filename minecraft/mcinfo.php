            <h1>You can connect to our Minecraft server using the ip: mc.ForeverAFK.net</h1>
            <h1>Click <a href="http://mc.foreverafk.net:8123/">here</a> to view the live map.</h1>
            <h1>A full commands list can be found <a href="/minecraft/commands.php">here</a>.</br>

            <h1>Minecraft Server</h1>
            <h2>Server Information</h2>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZNO1mptPrOU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </br>
            </br>
            <h2>Server Rules</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Asking for Mod will get you kicked. Asking again will get you banned. Being a Mod is a responsibility, not an honor. It will also tell me that you haven't even bothered to read the rules.</li>
                <li>Client mods are allowed only if they do not alter gameplay and are in good spirit with the game. For example, maps and graphical mods are allowed, but flying and hack clients are not. When in doubt ask a Mod.</li>
                <li>Any attempt to cheat/hack will be swiftly rewarded with a permaban. This includes exploiting bugs on the server that obviously shouldn't be there. Please report these issues to a Mod immediately.</li>
                <li>There is absolutely NO GRIEFING in Sigby.</li>
                <li>Khutu is unprotected and free-for-all. Protect yourself and your things at all times.</li>
                <li>Use common sense and be respectful. We are all here to have fun, and the Mods are here to help make the server a good place for everyone.</li>
            </ol>
            </br>
            <h2>Server Policy</h2>
            <h3>Ranks and Promotion</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>[ASP] - Aspirant - This is the default rank. Players may only access Khutu.</li>
                <li>[SUR] - Survivalist - After two hours playtime an Aspirant is promoted to Survivalist. They can now access Crafterville and claim plots there with protection. They may build on someone else's plot in Sigby if the owner permits it.</li>
                <li>[CRA] - Crafter - Crafters are players who have purchased large plots in game with Loyalty Points. Lords may rent parts of their land to Gendry's for whatever price they see fit(with in-game items like diamonds, iron, gold, etc.). Lords are the keepers of the protected areas and handle disputes within their plots.</li>
                <li>(Various titles) - VIP - This is our VIP rank. We honor our best friends and special guests with this rank.</li>
                <li>[JOF] - Junior Officer - Junior Officers will be added in the near future</li>
                <li>[Officer] - Senior Officer - Listen to these people or you will get rekt.
                <li>YouTubers & Streamers - If you make Minecraft videos or stream online while on our server we would love to give you special recognition! Please send us a link to your pages either in game or email to ash@foreverafk.net and we can work out special ranks.</li>
            </ol>
            </br>
            <h3>Getting Help</h3>
            If you have any problems on the server and no officers are available, please type:
            </br>
            /ticket &lt;message&gt;
            </br>
            This way an officer can take care of whatever issue your having when they log on. For more lengthy correspondence, please e-mail Ash: Ash@ForeverAFK.net
            </br>
            <h1>Mumble VOIP</h1>
            We also host a Mumble chat server if you want to talk voice-to-voice. You can usually find Erk and Ash in there when they are on. If we do happen to be streaming we ask that you configure push-to-talk or have a decent noise gate, otherwise we will mute you.
